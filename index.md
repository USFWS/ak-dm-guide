Planning, acquiring, maintaining, sharing, and archiving are all important steps of proper data management. The Alaska Region Data Management Guide was designed to walk staff through each of these steps, with procedures, documents, and best practices specific to the Region. Fisheries and Ecological Services, Migratory Bird Management, National Wildlife Refuge System, and the Office of Subsistence Management staff should look to this guide for **regional** data management support. Supplementing this document are additional region-specific resources, including:

- [**Alaska Region Metadata Guide**](https://doi.org/10.7944/P9S972WM), which provides region-specific guidance on how to create archive-quality metadata using [mdEditor](https://www.mdeditor.org/).
- [**Trainings**](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-ak-data-forum/SitePages/Alaska-Data-Management-Training.aspx) with accompanying handouts developed to assist staff with particular data management topics like file organization and tidy tabular data.
- [**AK Data Forum**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aDOALAy1dGUC9Hf2LrdHW8tyL438XvRuD4h3SeMCOnzQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=30e71f75-c08f-484a-b64a-f08f4e3af34f\&tenantId=0693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494), a Microsoft Team with a channel dedicated to receiving and answering staff inquiries.
- [**Alaska Region Data Management**](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-FF07S00000-data) SharePoint site, which contains important templates and the latest data management news.
